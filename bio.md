## Bio

After graduating my bachelor in __Media and Computer Science__ i started working as a __Big Data Engineer__ @ING-DiBa. We did a lot of cool stuff including terabytes of real-time data gathering to provide centralized logging for devs via a plethora of kubernetes managed elasticsearch clusters, all things automated.  

I left for Vienna to do my masters in __Data Science__ @[TU-Vienna](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/), where i had to do [30](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/curriculum/public/curriculum.xhtml?dswid=9531&dsrid=626&locale=en&key=67853) courses in 1.5 years and learned so much. 

Since 2022 i am a __Researcher__, __Senior Engineer__ and __Data Scientist__ @Fraunhofer-IIS in Nuremberg. 

My focus areas are: classical ML, Deep Learning, NLP, data visualization

I mostly work in __Python__ but i know my way around Java, R, C# and some Scala.

As a result of my years of experience i used a lot of libraries, algorithms and models. I am not an expert in all of them but here is a somewhat comprehensive list of what i have worked with:
