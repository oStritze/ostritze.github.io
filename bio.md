- Department [Supply Chain Services](https://www.scs.fraunhofer.de/en.html)
- Working on state funded and industrial research projects. AI assistants in production, logistics and health care. See [Projects experts]({{site.baseurl}}/projects) for a detailed overview.

### 03/2021 - 08/2021
- __Tutor / Student Assistant__ Data Intensive Computing @ [TU-Vienna](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/)
- Supervision and grading of multiple coding assignments consisting of Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark to identify important terms using tf-idf and $Chi^2$ calculations of terms in review texts in the _Amazon Reviews Dataset_.  

### 09/2020 - 01/2021
- __Student Assistant__ @ [TU-Vienna](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/)
- Working on a Jupyter-as-a-Service project, providing cloud-based developing workspaces for students and courses of different disciplines. Focused on supplying automated infrastructure and deployment on Microsoft Azure and on-premise Redhat OpenStack clusters with Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, Harbor and KeyCloak.

### 09/2017 - 09/2019
- __Big Data DevOps Engineer__ @ [ING-DiBa AG](www.ing.de)

## Academia 
### 10/2019 - 10/2022
- __Master of Science__, Data Science @ [TU-Vienna](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/)
- Curriculum: Over 30 courses of the [curriculum](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/curriculum/public/curriculum.xhtml?dswid=9531&dsrid=626&locale=en&key=67853) had to be visited where we worked on a lot of different problems and algorithms.
- Thesis: Predicting and communicating outcome of COVID-19 hospitalizations with medical images and clinical data

### 10/2012 - 09/2017
- __Bachelor of Science__, Computer Science and Media @ TH Nuremberg 
- Thesis: Evaluation of Apache Flink & Apache Spark when dealing with real-time detection of
fraud in log data from public web servers in cooperation with ING-DiBa AG.

<!-- After graduating my bachelor in __Media and Computer Science__ i started working as a __Big Data Engineer__ @ING-DiBa. We did a lot of cool stuff including terabytes of real-time data gathering to provide centralized logging for devs via a plethora of kubernetes managed elasticsearch clusters, all things automated.  

I left for Vienna to do my masters in __Data Science__ @[TU-Vienna](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/), where i had to do [30](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/curriculum/public/curriculum.xhtml?dswid=9531&dsrid=626&locale=en&key=67853) courses in 1.5 years and learned so much. 

Since 2022 i am a __Researcher__, __Senior Engineer__ and __Data Scientist__ @Fraunhofer-IIS in Nuremberg. 

My focus areas are: classical ML, Deep Learning, NLP, data visualization

I mostly work in __Python__ but i know my way around Java, R, C# and some Scala. -->
